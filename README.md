# Developing-BookInventory-Graphical-User-Interface-Desktop-App
In this repository I have built a 'Book Inventory Desktop GUI Database App'. After runnning the code 'frontend+backend.py' we could see the app.
'frontend+backend_oops.py' also gives the same output and this code is same as 'frontend+backend.py', only difference is 'frontend+backend_oops.py' code is in OOPS.
We will import other codes as in these two codes.
Following steps are followed to develop this desktop app:
1. Designing the User Interface
2. Coding the frontend interface
3. Coding the backend
4. Connecting the frontend with the backend
5. Creating .exe and .app executables from the python script
