# Developing-BookInventory-Graphical-User-Interface-Desktop-App
In this repository I have built a 'Book Inventory Desktop GUI Database App' using Python and SQLite. 
I have created SQLite Database in which book information (Like name of book, author of book, date etc.) is stored.
Through UI of this app, we can view all the books present in the database, also add new book information, delete information, update information.
After runnning the code 'frontend+backend.py' we could see the app.
('frontend+backend_oops.py' code is same as 'frontend+backend.py' and give same output, only difference is 'frontend+backend_oops.py' code is in OOPS.)
We will import other codes in these two main codes.

Following steps are followed to develop this desktop app:
  1. Designing the User Interface
  2. Coding the frontend interface
  3. Coding the backend
  4. Connecting the frontend with the backend
  5. Creating .exe and .app executables from the python script
